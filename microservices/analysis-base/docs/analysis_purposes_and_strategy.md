## Analysis Approaches by Worker Type

The analysis-base microservice supports both individual processing and category processing, as defined in the Categories Model section.

## Scope Separation: Pipelines vs. Decision Trees

To maintain a clear separation of concerns in the analysis-base microservice, we define distinct responsibilities for pipelines and decision trees:

### What Goes in Processing Templates (Pipelines)
Processing templates (pipeline specifications) define:
- The sequence of components to execute
- Performance parameters (timeouts, batch sizes)
- Data sources and destinations
- Error handling and retry strategies
- Resource allocation requirements
- Monitoring configurations

**Rationale**: Processing templates address the **structural and operational** aspects of analysis. They answer "what happens, when, and in what order?" These are architectural concerns that should be relatively stable and require developer expertise to modify safely.

### What Goes in Decision Trees
Decision trees define:
- Which analysis approach to use (inter-batch, intra-batch, historical)
- Factor selection criteria for different content types
- Threshold values for classification decisions
- Conditional logic for different analysis paths
- Business rules for interpreting results
- Strategy selection based on content characteristics

**Rationale**: Decision trees address the **logical and business rule** aspects of analysis. They answer "why something should happen and what it means." These are domain-specific concerns that often need to change rapidly to adapt to business needs and can be safely modified by domain experts without deep technical knowledge.

### Implementation Example

For a social media content batch:

**In Processing Template (Pipeline Specification)**:
```yaml
# Structural definition of how processing happens
components:
  - name: "batch_data_collector"
    type: "collector"
  - name: "feature_extractor"
    type: "feature_extractor"
  - name: "analysis_strategy_selector"
    type: "analyzer"
    config:
      decision_tree: "analysis_strategy_selection"
  - name: "factor_analyzer"
    type: "analyzer"
  - name: "results_persister"
    type: "storage"
```

**In Decision Tree (Analysis Strategy Selection)**:
```yaml
# Logical rules for which analysis approach to use
root:
  condition: "context.batch_size"
  branches:
    - value: "> 100"
      outcome:
        analysis_type: "intra_batch"
        reason: "Batch large enough for internal comparison"
    - value: "< 5"
      outcome:
        analysis_type: "inter_batch" 
        reason: "Batch too small for internal comparison"
    - default:
      child:
        condition: "context.has_historical_data"
        branches:
          - value: true
            outcome:
              analysis_type: "historical"
              reason: "Historical data available for trending"
          - value: false
            outcome:
              analysis_type: "inter_batch"
              reason: "No historical data available"
```

This separation ensures that:
1. Domain experts can focus on the business logic (which analysis approach makes sense in which situation) without needing to understand or modify the technical implementation of the processing pipeline itself.
2. Developers can maintain and enhance the pipeline infrastructure without disrupting business logic.

## Implementation Requirements

To support both individual and category processing across different analysis types, the restructured analysis-base microservice will need:

1. **Enhanced Component Architecture**:
   - Components that can process both individuals and categories using the same interfaces
   - Configuration-driven behavior that adapts to the type of entity being analyzed
   - Context-aware processing that detects whether it's working with an individual or category

2. **Specialized Components**:
   - `ObjectPerformanceAnalyzer` - Analyzes category objects directly
   - `FactorLifecyclePredictorComponent` - Predicts factor effectiveness lifecycle
   - `SecretSauceAnalyzerComponent` - Measures secret sauce performance
   - `BatchAnalyzerComponent` - Analyzes batch characteristics and performance
   - `CampaignAnalyzerComponent` - Evaluates campaign performance over time

3. **Unified Context Model**:
   - Context object that can represent both individual and category analysis
   - Clear indications of analysis type and target entity type
   - Support for inter-batch, intra-batch, and historical analysis contexts

4. **Decision Tree Catalog**:
   - Platform-specific trees (Instagram, Etsy, etc.)
   - Analysis-type specific trees (descriptive, diagnostic, etc.)
   - Entity-type specific trees (factor, secret sauce, batch, campaign)
   - Combinations of the above (e.g., "instagram_factor_descriptive_analysis")

This implementation approach ensures that the analysis-base microservice can support all the analysis purposes across different platforms, for both individuals and categories, following the clear separation of concerns between pipelines and decision trees.
