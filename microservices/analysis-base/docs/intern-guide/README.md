# Analysis-Base Intern Guide

Welcome to the Analysis-Base microservice team! This guide will help you understand how to create and use processing templates and decision trees, which are the core components of our analysis system.

## Overview of Analysis-Base

The Analysis-Base microservice is responsible for performing various types of analysis on content across different platforms (Instagram, Etsy, etc.) and entity types (individuals, categories, campaigns, etc.). It supports four types of analysis:

1. **Descriptive Analysis**: What happened (performance metrics, correlations)
2. **Diagnostic Analysis**: Why it happened (root causes, strengths/weaknesses)
3. **Predictive Analysis**: What will happen (forecasting, simulations)
4. **Prescriptive Analysis**: What should be done (recommendations, optimizations)

## Key Architecture Concepts

Our architecture follows a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Generic Components**: Reusable processing blocks that perform specific tasks (data collection, feature extraction, analysis, etc.)

2. **Processing Templates**: Define sequences of generic components to accomplish specific analytical purposes. They determine "what happens in what order" but not "why" or "how".

3. **Decision Trees**: Contain domain-specific intelligence and analytical logic. They encode "what factors matter in which contexts" and "how to interpret results".

## Getting Started

To contribute to the analysis-base microservice, follow these steps:

1. Read through this guide to understand the basic concepts
2. Review the [Processing Template Guide](./processing_template_guide.md) to learn how to create templates
3. Study the [Decision Tree Guide](./decision_tree_guide.md) to understand how to define analytical logic
4. Examine the examples in each guide to see practical implementations
5. Start creating your own templates and trees for your assigned domains

## Directory Structure

```

## Workflow for Creating Analysis Capabilities

1. **Define Purpose**: Clearly define what type of analysis you need to implement
2. **Create Processing Template**: Define the sequence of components needed
3. **Design Decision Trees**: Create trees containing domain-specific analytical logic
4. **Test Your Implementation**: Verify correct operation and results
5. **Submit for Review**: Add to the specification directory and submit PR

## Development Principles

1. **Reusability**: Processing templates should be generic and reusable across domains
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep structural logic in templates, domain logic in trees
3. **Composition**: Complex analyses can be built by chaining simpler templates
4. **Documentation**: Always document your templates and trees thoroughly

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need guidance:
- Ask your mentor
- Check the existing examples in the specs directory
- Review the component implementation in the src/modules directory

Happy analyzing!
