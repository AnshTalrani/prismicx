# Tenant Management: User Details and Insights Integration

## Overview

This document outlines how microservices within the MACH architecture should interact with the User Details microservice to access user extensions and insights data. It provides guidelines for data access patterns, batch processing operations, summarization capabilities, and additional use cases.

## Data Access Patterns

### Reading User Data

#### HTTP API Integration
Other microservices should interact with user details through the RESTful API endpoints exposed by the user_details microservice:

- **Individual Data Access**:
  - `/api/v1/insights/{user_id}` - Get a specific user's insight data
  - `/api/v1/insights/{user_id}/topics/{topic_id}` - Get a specific topic for a user
  - `/api/v1/extensions/{extension_id}` - Get a specific extension details

- **User Collection Access**:
  - `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/extensions` - Get all extensions for a specific user

- **Cross-User Queries**:
  - `/api/v1/topics/{topic_name}/users` - Find all users that have a specific topic

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Each request must include `X-Tenant-ID` header for multi-tenancy
- Services should implement proper authentication using a service-to-service authentication mechanism
- Consider using JWT tokens or API keys for authorization between services

#### Data Caching Strategy

- High-traffic services should implement local caching of frequently accessed user data
- Implement cache invalidation based on webhook notifications or time-based expiration
- Consider using Redis or a similar distributed cache for shared caching needs

## Batch Processing Operations

### Bulk Data Operations

- Use the `/api/v1/insights/batch` endpoint for processing multiple operations in a single transaction
- Format batch requests as arrays of operation objects, each with an operation type and payload:
  ```json
  {
    "operations": [
      {
        "operation": "ADD_TOPIC",
        "user_id": "user123",
        "payload": {
          "name": "Investment Strategy",
          "description": "User's investment preferences and strategies"
        }
      },
      {
        "operation": "UPDATE_EXTENSION",
        "extension_id": "ext456",
        "payload": {
          "metrics": {
            "usage_count": 42,
            "feedback_score": 4.8
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Batch operations should be idempotent to handle retry scenarios

### Asynchronous Processing

- For large-scale batch operations, implement a message queue system (like RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Producer services publish batch job requests
- User details service works as a consumer, processing requests asynchronously
- Implement a job status tracking mechanism with webhooks for completion notifications
- Example flow:
  1. Service submits batch job to queue
  2. Returns job ID immediately
  3. User details service processes job asynchronously
  4. On completion, status update is pushed to requesting service

### ETL Processes

- Implement scheduled jobs for Extract-Transform-Load operations across multiple users
- Use data pagination for large dataset processing
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed batch operations
- Consider using transaction boundaries for atomic operations

## Summarization Capabilities

### Topic-Based Summarization

- Use `/api/v1/topics/{topic_name}/summary` to generate aggregated views across users
- Implement filtering parameters to focus summarization on specific user segments
- Cache summaries with appropriate expiration based on data volatility
- Example use case: Generate aggregated insights on "Investment Preferences" across all users in a tenant

### User Insight Snapshots

- The `/api/v1/insights/{user_id}/snapshot` endpoint provides condensed data for quick decision-making
- Services should use snapshots for performance-critical operations rather than full data
- Consider implementing webhook notifications for significant snapshot changes

### Aggregation Pipeline

- Implement a MapReduce-style processing pipeline for complex summarization tasks
- Design summary schemas to support hierarchical data visualization
- Consider implementing materialized views for frequently requested summaries

## Additional Use Cases

### Recommendation Engine Integration

- Marketing services can use user insights/extensions to power personalization
- Feed user topic data into recommendation algorithms
- Correlate extension practicality scores with recommendation relevance
- Example implementation:
  1. Periodically fetch user insights for active users
  2. Process data through recommendation model
  3. Store recommendations for quick retrieval

### User Segmentation & Targeting

- Analysis services can create segments based on user insights
- Identify users with similar topic interests for community building
- Develop lookalike audiences based on extension usage patterns
- Implementation approach:
  1. Query users by topic with filtering
  2. Process results to identify segments
  3. Store segment definitions for reuse

### Contextual Content Delivery

- Communication services can tailor messages based on user insights
- Customize content delivery based on extension practicality scores
- Schedule communications based on user engagement patterns
- Example: Personalize newsletter content based on user's topic interests

### Predictive Analytics

- Implement machine learning models that use insights/extensions as features
- Predict user churn based on engagement metrics in extensions
- Forecast future user interests based on topic evolution
- Consider implementing feature extraction pipelines that pull from user details

### Compliance & Governance

- Implement data retention policies based on tenant requirements
- Provide data export capabilities for regulatory compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- Track data lineage for audit purposes
- Consider implementing automated PII detection and handling

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Always follow idempotent design patterns for API calls
2. Implement appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms
3. Use circuit breakers for resilience against downstream failures
4. Monitor API usage and performance
5. Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
6. Document API changes and maintain backward compatibility
7. Use semantic versioning for API endpoints
