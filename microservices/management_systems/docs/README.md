# Management Systems Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Management Systems microservice.

## Overview

The Management Systems microservice is a core component of our multi-tenant architecture that provides functionality for creating, managing, and interacting with business systems and their data across different tenants. It serves as a flexible system management platform that allows:

1. Definition of system templates and customizable business systems
2. Creation of tenant-specific system instances
3. Management of data within these system instances
4. Event-driven automation and workflows
5. Support for multi-tenancy, ensuring data isolation between tenants
