# Architectural Patterns in Agent Microservice

This document outlines the key architectural patterns used in the Agent microservice implementation.

## Clean Architecture

The service follows Clean Architecture principles with well-defined layers:

1. **Domain Layer** - Contains business entities, value objects, and repository interfaces
2. **Application Layer** - Contains use cases and service interfaces
3. **Infrastructure Layer** - Contains implementations of repositories, service interfaces, and clients
4. **API Layer** - Contains controllers and request/response DTOs

Dependencies point inward, with the domain layer having no dependencies on outer layers, ensuring proper separation of concerns.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The service uses dependency inversion extensively:

- High-level modules (use cases) depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- Low-level modules (implementations) also depend on abstractions
- Abstractions do not depend on details

Key examples:
- `IOrchestrationService` interface is used by use cases, while `DefaultOrchestrationService` provides the implementation
- `ITemplateRepository` interface is defined in the domain layer, while implementations reside in the infrastructure layer

## Strategy Pattern

The `DefaultOrchestrationService` uses the Strategy pattern to dynamically select service clients:

```python
# Map of service types to their handler methods
self._service_handlers = {
    ServiceType.GENERATIVE: self._handle_generative,
    # Other handlers...
}

# Dynamic selection
handler = self._service_handlers[template.service_type]
result = await handler(template, context)
```

This allows:
- Easy addition of new service types without modifying existing code
- Runtime selection of handler strategy based on template properties

## Repository Pattern

The `ITemplateRepository` interface defines a contract for accessing templates:

```python
async def get_by_id(self, template_id: str) -> Optional[ExecutionTemplate]:
    """Get a template by ID."""
    pass
```

Benefits:
- Abstract data access logic from business logic
- Multiple implementations (file-based, database-based) can be swapped easily
- Simplified testing with mock repositories

## Adapter Pattern

Service clients like `GenerativeClient` serve as adapters between our system and external services:

- They translate our domain concepts to the external service's API
- They handle communication details (HTTP, authentication)
- They provide fallback mechanisms (mock responses) when services are unavailable

## Factory Method Pattern

The `ExecutionTemplate.from_dict()` static method serves as a factory method:

```python
@classmethod
def from_dict(cls, data: Dict[str, Any]) -> 'ExecutionTemplate':
    """Create template from dictionary."""
    # ...
    return cls(...)
```

This encapsulates the logic for creating domain objects from raw data.

## Command Pattern

Request processing follows the Command pattern:

- Request parameters encapsulate an action to be performed
- The action is executed by a handler (use case)
- The result is returned without exposing internal details

## Separation of Concerns

Clear separation of concerns is maintained throughout:

- **Templates**: Focus on routing and orchestration concerns, not service-specific details
- **Services**: Each service has a single responsibility (orchestration, template management, etc.)
- **Clients**: Handle communication with external services
- **Repositories**: Handle data persistence and retrieval

## Decorator Pattern

The microservice uses decorators for cross-cutting concerns:

- Logging is applied consistently through logger decorators
- Error handling is centralized in service methods
- Authentication and authorization can be applied as decorators to controller methods

## Observer Pattern (for Batch Processing)

Batch processing uses an Observer-like pattern:

- Batch items are processed independently
- Progress updates are tracked and can notify observers
- Final completion triggers notifications to interested parties

## Benefits of These Patterns

1. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and modify
2. **Testability**: Interfaces and dependency injection make unit testing straightforward
3. **Flexibility**: New implementations can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently based on load
5. **Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms handle external service failures gracefully
