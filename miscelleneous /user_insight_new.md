2. **User Insight Extension Repository Integration**
   - **Implement connections to platform-specific User Insight Extension repositories**
     - Create Instagram User Insight connector
     - Create Etsy User Insight connector
     - Create adapter interfaces for additional platforms
     - **Note: Each platform (Instagram, Etsy, etc.) will have its own dedicated User Insight Extension repository**
   - **Develop standardized data access patterns for user-level metrics**
     - **IMPORTANT: All user-level metrics will be sourced exclusively from User Insight Extension repositories**
     - **No user metrics should be retrieved from any other data source to ensure consistency**
     - Create abstraction layer to handle platform-specific user insight data formats
     - Implement standardized interfaces that abstract away platform differences
   - **Map platform-specific user metrics to standardized metric framework**
     - Transform platform-specific engagement metrics to standard format
     - Normalize user interaction patterns across platforms
     - Align with the platform-specific metrics defined in the standardized metric framework
     - Create bidirectional mappings between platform-specific and standard metrics
   - **Implement user context processors for different platforms**
     - Create user history analyzers for each platform
