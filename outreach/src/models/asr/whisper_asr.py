# TODO: Implement Whisper ASR with the following features:
# - Async wrapper around whisper.cpp
# - Model loading and management
# - Audio preprocessing
# - Language detection
# - Batch processing support
# - Performance optimization for real-time streaming
# - Error handling and fallback mechanisms

# Example method signature (to be implemented):
# async def transcribe(self, audio_data: bytes, **kwargs) -> str:
#     """Transcribe audio using whisper.cpp."""
#     pass
