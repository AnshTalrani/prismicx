# Financial Analysis Processing Flow

## User Input
```
"Our operating costs have increased by 15% this quarter. Can you help me analyze possible causes and suggest strategies to improve our profit margins?"
```

## Processing Flow

### 1. Initial Request Processing
- `handle_request()` function receives the prompt, session_id, and user_id
- Session data is retrieved via `session_manager.get_or_create_session()`
- User profile retrieved: `user_profile = profile_store.get_user_profile(user_id)`
- Conversation memory loaded: `memory = session_manager.get_session_memory(session_id)`
- Recent topics from memory checked (none detected in this initial query)

### 2. NLP Processing
- Text is processed through `nlp_processor.process_text(prompt)`
  - Cleaned text using `_clean_text()` method
  - spaCy processing extracts entities, keywords, and structure
  - Detected entities: ["operating costs", "15%", "quarter", "profit margins"]
  - Entity types mapped: ["FINANCIAL": "costs", "profit"]
  - Sentiment analysis: slightly negative sentiment (0.45)
  - Domain terms extracted: ["finance": ["cost", "profit", "margin"]]
  - Urgency analysis: medium (0.4)
  - Request type: "question"

### 3. Detection Rule Matching
- `process_message_with_rules()` evaluates the text against configured rules
- "financial_question" rule matched:
  - Keywords matched: ["cost", "profit", "margin"]
  - Required entities matched: ["FINANCIAL"]
  - Sentiment within range: [0.4, 0.9]
  - Confidence score: 0.78 (threshold: 0.6)
  - Matched action: "use_finance_adapter"

### 4. Action Execution
- `execute_action("use_finance_adapter", context)` is called
- `handle_adapter_selection()` processes the action:
  - Adapter "finance" is selected and activated
  - `active_adapter` is set to "finance"
  - Action result stored and logged for monitoring

### 5. Chain Creation with Specialized Adapter
- `create_specialized_chain()` creates a chain with:
  - Base LLM: consultancy_bot.llm
  - Active adapter: "finance"
  - Memory context included for conversation continuity
  - User profile included for personalization
  - Finance-specific retrieval domains activated

### 6. Response Generation
- Chain is invoked with the prompt, chat history, and user profile
- Finance adapter focuses response on financial analysis and strategies
- Raw response generated addressing cost analysis and profit margin improvement

### 7. Post-Processing
- Generated response is analyzed with `process_message_with_rules()`
- "finance_response_quality" rule matched
- `enhance_response` action triggered with "finance_response_quality" enhancement type

### 8. Response Enhancement
- `response_enhancer.enhance_response()` applies enhancements:
  - Domain-specific terminology added: ["ROI", "P&L", "EBITDA"]
  - Financial citations added:
    ```
    1. Financial Management Review: 'Modern Financial Analysis' (2023)
    2. Journal of Corporate Finance: 'Investment Decision Frameworks' (2022)
    ```
  - Financial framework included: "Break-even Analysis"
  - Checked minimum length requirement (200 words)

### 9. Final Output Preparation
- Enhanced response saved to conversation memory
- Interaction logged via mlops.log_interaction()
- Final response returned to user

## Final Response (Sample)
```
To address the 15% increase in operating costs and improve profit margins, I'll analyze potential causes and recommend strategies.

Possible causes of increased operating costs:

1. Inflation: General price increases affecting raw materials, utilities, and services.
2. Supply chain disruptions: Higher logistics or material costs due to disruptions.
3. Labor costs: Wage increases, overtime, or staffing changes.
4. Energy prices: Significant increases in energy or fuel costs.
5. Inefficiencies: Process inefficiencies that have developed over time.

Strategies to improve profit margins:

1. Cost Structure Analysis: Perform a detailed breakdown of fixed vs. variable costs to identify specific areas of increase.
   
2. Supplier Renegotiation: Review supplier contracts and explore alternative suppliers or bulk purchasing options.

3. Process Optimization: Identify and eliminate inefficiencies in operations through lean methodologies.

4. Strategic Pricing Review: Analyze if modest price increases can be implemented without significant impact on demand.

5. Energy Efficiency: Implement energy-saving measures to reduce utility costs.

6. Technology Implementation: Consider automation for repetitive tasks to reduce labor costs.

7. Revenue Enhancement: Look for opportunities to increase sales volume through new channels or product offerings.

8. Fixed Cost Reduction: Evaluate office space, equipment leases, and other fixed costs for potential savings.

You should monitor your EBITDA, P&L, and cash flow statements monthly to track improvements.

You can analyze this using the Break-even Analysis framework:
- Fixed Costs: [Specific insights would be derived from your situation]
- Variable Costs: [Specific insights would be derived from your situation]
- Contribution Margin: [Specific insights would be derived from your situation]
- Break-even Point: [Specific insights would be derived from your situation]
