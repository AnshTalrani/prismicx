Certainly! Based on the file structure you've provided, here's a draft of an architecture document for your codebase.

# Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the codebase, detailing its structure, components, and how they interact. The application is evolving to adopt MACH (Microservices-based, API-first, Cloud-native, and Headless) architecture principles to ensure flexibility, scalability, and best-in-class capabilities.

## Codebase Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **Dockerfile**
- **requirements.txt**
- **microservices/**
  - **analysis-base/**
    - **Dockerfile**
    - **requirements.txt**
    - **src/**
      - **analysis_main.py**
- **monolith/**
  - **main.py**

## Components

### 1. Monolithic Application

- **Location**: `monolith/main.py`
- **Description**: Serves as the primary application orchestrating the overall workflow.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles user interactions or external requests.
  - Coordinates tasks between different services.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt` at the root level.
- **Containerization**: Uses the root-level `Dockerfile` for building its Docker image.

### 2. Microservices

#### a. Analysis Base Service

- **Location**: `microservices/analysis-base/src/analysis_main.py`
- **Description**: Performs data analysis tasks.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes input data for analysis.
  - Generates reports or analytics results.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `microservices/analysis-base/requirements.txt`.
- **Containerization**: Has its own `Dockerfile` for building the Docker image specific to this service.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Dockerization

- **Purpose**: Containerize applications for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Monolith**:
  - **Dockerfile**: Located at the root level.
  - **Build Command**: `docker build -t monolith-app .`
- **Microservices**:
  - **Dockerfile**: Each microservice has its own Dockerfile.
  - **Build Command**: Navigate to the microservice directory and run `docker build -t analysis-base-service .`

### Dependencies Management

- **Root `requirements.txt`**:
  - Contains dependencies for the monolithic application.
- **Microservice `requirements.txt`**:
  - Each microservice manages its own dependencies to ensure isolation and reduce conflicts.

## Application Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The monolithic application starts and initializes necessary configurations.
2. **Request Handling**:
   - Receives requests or data inputs.
3. **Service Coordination**:
   - The monolith delegates tasks to the `analysis-base` microservice when analysis is required.
4. **Data Processing**:
   - `analysis_main.py` processes the data.
5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Results from the microservice are collected by the monolith.
6. **Response Generation**:
   - The monolith compiles the final output to be returned to the user or system.

## Communication Between Components

- **Inter-process Communication**:
  - Could be RESTful APIs, message queues, or direct method calls (depending on implementation).
- **Data Exchange Formats**:
  - Common formats like JSON or XML for data interchange.

## MACH Architecture Alignment

### Microservices-Based
- The microservices (e.g., the "analysis-base" service) each have focused responsibilities and are independently containerized.
- To further align with MACH, consider extracting additional functionalities from the monolithic application into separate microservices where feasible.

### API-First
- All services expose well-defined RESTful or similar APIs for communication.
- The monolith coordinates tasks via these APIs, ensuring loose coupling and enabling external or future clients to integrate easily.

### Cloud-Native
- Docker-based containerization is in place, allowing for seamless deployment across various cloud platforms.
- Consider leveraging cloud services or orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) to enhance scalability and reliability.

### Headless
- The backend services, whether monolith or microservices, remain decoupled from any specific frontend layer.
- Moving toward a fully headless setup would allow multiple frontends (mobile, web, IoT, etc.) to consume the same APIs for consistent experiences.
