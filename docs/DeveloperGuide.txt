## Project Overview
This project follows a structured approach by adhering to the existing directory layout. We focus on writing code with clear docstrings and robust error handling, along with a disciplined approach to version control.

---
## MACH Architecture
MACH stands for:
- **Microservices-based**: Each part of the application is designed to be a separate service.
- **API-first**: All functionalities are exposed via APIs.
- **Cloud-native**: The application is architected and designed for cloud environments.
- **Headless**: The systemâ€™s back-end services are decoupled from the front-end/UI components.

Aligning with the MACH approach ensures that any service is loosely coupled and can evolve independently.

## Git Flow Strategy
This repository uses the Git Flow branching model to manage development and releases. Below is the initialization step, which you can reproduce by running:

```
git flow init -f
```

During the initialization, you'll be prompted for several options. Here are the choices to make:

- **Branch name for production releases**: `main`
- **Branch name for "next release" development**: `develop`
- **Feature branch prefix**: `feature/`
- **Bugfix branch prefix**: `bugfix/`
- **Release branch prefix**: `release/`
- **Hotfix branch prefix**: `hotfix/`
- **Support branch prefix**: `support/`
- **Version tag prefix**: `v`

By using Git Flow, you will create branches off of `develop` for new features and bug fixes.

---
## Error Handling & Input Validation
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs from external sources to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks or equivalent mechanisms to handle runtime errors gracefully.
- **Logging**: Log errors where they occur for better observability and debugging.

---
## Security Considerations
- **Sensitive Data Management**: Store and manage sensitive data (e.g., API keys, credentials) securely and never commit them to version control. Use environment variables, secure key stores, or Docker secrets.
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Access Control**: Enforce least privilege for services and APIs to prevent unauthorized access to data.

---
## Testing Guidelines
- **Unit Tests**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all functions and classes.
- **Integration Tests**: Include integration tests if the feature interacts with external systems.
- **Automation**: Automate tests via a CI/CD pipeline so that code changes are always validated.
