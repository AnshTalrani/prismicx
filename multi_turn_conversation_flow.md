# Multi-Turn Conversation with Memory Context Flow

## Conversation History
### Previous User Message (Turn 1)

"We're considering transitioning from our legacy on-premise CRM to a cloud-based solution. What factors should we consider?"
```

### Previous Bot Response (Turn 1)

When transitioning from legacy on-premise CRM to a cloud-based solution, consider these key factors:

1. Data Migration: Analyze your current data structure and cleanliness. Create a detailed migration plan that includes mapping fields, handling custom data, and validating data integrity post-migration.

2. Integration Requirements: Identify all current CRM integrations with other business systems (ERP, marketing automation, etc.) and verify compatibility with potential cloud solutions.

3. Customization Needs: Determine which customizations in your legacy system are essential and ensure the cloud solution can support them without excessive development.

4. Total Cost of Ownership: Compare the complete costs including subscription fees, implementation services, additional modules, and ongoing support versus current maintenance costs.

5. User Adoption Strategy: Develop a change management plan that includes training, communication, and potentially phased rollout to ensure user adoption.

6. Security and Compliance: Ensure the cloud provider meets your industry's regulatory requirements and your internal security standards.

7. Scalability: Evaluate how well the solution will scale with your projected business growth over the next 3-5 years.

8. Vendor Evaluation: Assess potential vendors on product capabilities, implementation expertise, support quality, and financial stability.

Strategic concepts to leverage: market positioning, value proposition, and competitive advantage.

## Current Interaction (Turn 2)

### User Input
```
"From those factors, which ones are most critical for a mid-size manufacturing company with sensitive customer data?"
```

## Processing Flow

### 1. Initial Request Processing
- `handle_request()` function receives the prompt, session_id, and user_id
- Session data retrieved: `session = session_manager.get_or_create_session()`
- User profile retrieved: `user_profile = profile_store.get_user_profile(user_id)`
- Conversation memory loaded: `memory = session_manager.get_session_memory(session_id)`

### 2. Memory Context Analysis
- Recent messages retrieved from memory:
  - Last user message: "We're considering transitioning from our legacy on-premise CRM to a cloud-based solution. What factors should we consider?"
  - Last bot response: Contains the 8 factors for CRM transition
- Memory context constructed:
  ```python
  memory_context = {
      "topics": ["strategy", "technology"],
      "message_count": 2,
      "previous_entities": ["CRM", "cloud", "on-premise", "transition"]
  }
  ```

### 3. NLP Processing
- Text is processed through `nlp_processor.process_text(prompt)`
  - Cleaned text using `_clean_text()` method
  - Entities extracted: ["factors", "mid-size manufacturing company", "sensitive customer data"]
  - Entity types mapped: ["BUSINESS": "company"]
  - Domain terms extracted: ["strategy": ["factors"]]
  - Request understanding enhanced by memory context:
    - References to "those factors" resolved to the 8 CRM transition factors
    - Co-reference resolution applied

### 4. Detection Rule Matching
- `process_message_with_rules()` evaluates the text against configured rules
- Context-boosted matching applied using memory_context
- "strategy_question" rule matched:
  - Keywords matched: ["critical", "factors"]
  - Required entities matched: ["BUSINESS"]
  - Memory context match: Previous topics included "strategy"
  - Contextual boost applied: +0.1 to confidence
  - Final confidence score: 0.72 (threshold: 0.6)
  - Matched action: "use_strategy_adapter"

### 5. Action Execution
- `execute_action("use_strategy_adapter", context)` is called
- `handle_adapter_selection()` processes the action:
  - Adapter "strategy" is selected and activated
  - `active_adapter` is set to "strategy"
  - Action result stored for monitoring

### 6. Memory-Enhanced Chain Creation
- `create_specialized_chain()` creates a chain with:
  - Base LLM: consultancy_bot.llm
  - Active adapter: "strategy"
  - Memory context from previous exchanges included
  - Memory window size: 20 messages
  - Previous conversation context automatically included

### 7. Response Generation
- Chain is invoked with memory-aware context:
  ```python
  response = await chain.ainvoke({
      "question": prompt,
      "chat_history": memory.chat_memory.messages,  # Full conversation history
      "user_profile": user_profile
  })
  ```
- Strategy adapter focuses on prioritizing factors for manufacturing context
- Response generated that refers back to previous factors

### 8. Post-Processing
- Generated response is analyzed with `process_message_with_rules()`
- "strategy_response_quality" rule matched
- `enhance_response` action triggered with "strategy_response_quality" enhancement type

### 9. Response Enhancement
- `response_enhancer.enhance_response()` applies enhancements:
  - Domain-specific terminology added: ["competitive advantage", "market positioning"]
  - Strategy framework mentioned: "Risk Assessment Matrix"
  - Citations added relevant to manufacturing context
  - Checked minimum length requirement (250 words)

### 10. Final Output Preparation
- Enhanced response saved to conversation memory
- Memory updated with new context for future exchanges
- Final response returned to user

## Final Response (Sample)
```
For a mid-size manufacturing company with sensitive customer data, the most critical factors when transitioning from an on-premise CRM to a cloud solution are:

1. Security and Compliance (Highest Priority)
   Manufacturing companies often handle sensitive customer specifications, pricing agreements, and proprietary product information. Ensure the cloud CRM provides:
   - Industry-specific compliance capabilities (ISO 27001, SOC 2)
   - Data encryption both in transit and at rest
   - Granular role-based access controls
   - Data residency options to meet regional requirements
   - Audit logging and monitoring

2. Data Migration and Integrity
   Manufacturing customer data often includes complex relationships between accounts, contracts, orders, and product specifications:
   - Develop a comprehensive data mapping strategy
   - Maintain historical data on production orders and service requests
   - Preserve relationships between customers, products, and service history
   - Ensure bill of materials and product configuration data transfers accurately

3. Integration Requirements
   Manufacturing operations typically require seamless integration with:
   - ERP systems managing production and inventory
   - Supply chain management tools
   - Quality control systems
   - Production planning software
   - Ensure API capabilities can support these mission-critical integrations

4. Total Cost of Ownership
   For mid-size manufacturers, cost considerations are significant:
   - Compare 3-5 year TCO including implementation, customization, training
   - Consider potential productivity gains and how they offset costs
   - Evaluate how pricing scales with your projected growth
   - Account for potential downtime costs during transition

5. User Adoption Strategy
   Manufacturing environments often have diverse user groups with varying technical comfort:
   - Develop role-specific training for sales, service, and production teams
   - Consider shop floor access requirements
   - Plan phased implementation to minimize operational disruption

You can analyze these priorities using the Risk Assessment Matrix framework:
- Probability: [How likely are issues in each area]
- Impact: [Consequences of problems in each area]
- Risk Level: [Combined assessment of probability and impact]
- Mitigation Strategy: [How to address the identified risks]

This strategic approach will help establish your competitive advantage by ensuring your CRM transition supports your market positioning in the manufacturing sector.
