Certainly! Based on the file structure you've provided, here's a draft of an architecture document for your codebase.

# Architecture Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the codebase, detailing its structure, components, and how they interact. The application consists of a monolithic application and microservices, each with its own responsibilities and dependencies.

## Codebase Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:

- **Dockerfile**
- **requirements.txt**
- **microservices/**
  - **analysis-base/**
    - **Dockerfile**
    - **requirements.txt**
    - **src/**
      - **analysis_main.py**
- **monolith/**
  - **main.py**

## Components

### 1. Monolithic Application

- **Location**: `monolith/main.py`
- **Description**: Serves as the primary application orchestrating the overall workflow.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles user interactions or external requests.
  - Coordinates tasks between different services.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt` at the root level.
- **Containerization**: Uses the root-level `Dockerfile` for building its Docker image.

### 2. Microservices

#### a. Analysis Base Service

- **Location**: `microservices/analysis-base/src/analysis_main.py`
- **Description**: Performs data analysis tasks.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Processes input data for analysis.
  - Generates reports or analytics results.
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `microservices/analysis-base/requirements.txt`.
- **Containerization**: Has its own `Dockerfile` for building the Docker image specific to this service.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Dockerization

- **Purpose**: Containerize applications for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Monolith**:
  - **Dockerfile**: Located at the root level.
  - **Build Command**: `docker build -t monolith-app .`
- **Microservices**:
  - **Dockerfile**: Each microservice has its own Dockerfile.
  - **Build Command**: Navigate to the microservice directory and run `docker build -t analysis-base-service .`

### Dependencies Management

- **Root `requirements.txt`**:
  - Contains dependencies for the monolithic application.
- **Microservice `requirements.txt`**:
  - Each microservice manages its own dependencies to ensure isolation and reduce conflicts.

## Application Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The monolithic application starts and initializes necessary configurations.
2. **Request Handling**:
   - Receives requests or data inputs.
3. **Service Coordination**:
   - The monolith delegates tasks to the `analysis-base` microservice when analysis is required.
4. **Data Processing**:
   - `analysis_main.py` processes the data.
5. **Result Aggregation**:
   - Results from the microservice are collected by the monolith.
6. **Response Generation**:
   - The monolith compiles the final output to be returned to the user or system.

## Communication Between Components

- **Inter-process Communication**:
  - Could be RESTful APIs, message queues, or direct method calls (depending on implementation).
- **Data Exchange Formats**:
  - Common formats like JSON or XML for data interchange.

## Scaling Considerations

- **Microservices**:
  - Can be scaled independently based on load.
  - Helps in distributing the workload effectively.
- **Monolith**:
  - May become a bottleneck; consider modularizing if necessary.

## Development Practices

- **Version Control**:
  - Ensure all components are tracked using a version control system.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**:
  - Automate testing and deployment pipelines for reliability.
- **Coding Standards**:
  - Maintain consistent coding styles across all components for readability and maintenance.

## Security Considerations

- **Container Security**:
  - Regularly update base images to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**:
  - Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for any known security issues.
- **Data Security**:
  - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest if sensitive data is handled.

## Conclusion

The architecture leverages both monolithic and microservices paradigms to balance simplicity and scalability. By separating concerns and containerizing each component, the system is designed for easy maintenance and potential future growth.
